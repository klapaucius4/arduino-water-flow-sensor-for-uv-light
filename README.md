# Arduino water flow sensor for UV light

This is a project for my home's water system. It is responsible for turning off the UV lamp when the water flow is zero. This is to extend the life of the UV light bulb.

The main elements used in the project are:

- Arduno board (Uno)
- Water flow sensor (I used the YF-B10)
- One channel relay module
- 5V power supply (made from phone charger)
- 3 x LED 5mm (in three colors)
- 3-wire cable 230V
- 230V Socket
- few thin wires and resistors
- plastic housing, printed on a 3D printer
